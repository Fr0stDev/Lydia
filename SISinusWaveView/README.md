# SISinusWaveView

This subclass of NSView visualizes the user's voice input sound level using multiple sinus waves that move in an organic, vivid way. Heavily inspired by Apple's iOS 7 Siri interface.

## Dependencies

You need to add ```EZAudio``` to your project and add its dependencies (Frameworks).

## Usage

Usage should be clear once you see the annotated header file. In Interface Builder, drag a Custom View from the inspector and set its class to ```SISinusWaveView```.
